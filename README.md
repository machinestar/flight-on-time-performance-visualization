## Summary
The main goal of this project is to display the departure flight on-time performance in JFK airport (John F. Kennedy International Airport) of 2008. The on-time departure flights on each day were aggregated by week and carriers, then divided by total number of flight to calculate the percentage of departure flights which were on time. The audience will have capability to choose different carriers to display their on-time performance and make comparison. The figure will also automatically display the averaged performance and highlight the carrier with best on-time performance in each week.
